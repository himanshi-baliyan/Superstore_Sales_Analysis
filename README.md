# Superstore_Sales_Analysis

Superstore Data Cleaning using Python and Analysis using SQL

## Introduction
In this project, we wil use a real-world Superstore dataset which is provided by HiCounselor. It will train us how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance and how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database.

## Dataset
The dataset we will be using is available in the file [superstore_dataset.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eaEzUazVCo6cq1woWR_RkbVlBqo0RaCs/view). It contains the following columns:

Row_ID\
Order_ID\
Order_Date\
Ship_Date\
Ship_Mode\
Customer_ID\
Customer_Name\
Segment\
Country\
City\
State\
Postal_Code\
Region\
Product_ID\
Category\
Sub_Category\
Product_Name\
Sales

## Data Cleaning
Before we can begin analyzing the data, we need to clean it. We will be using Python and the Pandas library to do this. Some of the steps we will take include:

Step 1: Removing duplicate rows

Step 2: Removing rows for which few values are missing.

Step 3: Remove irrelevant values from each column if any. 

Step 4: Export the cleaned dataset as a .csv file: prefer UTF-8 encoding.

## Analyse data using MySQL:

In addition to Python, we will be using MySQL Workbench to efficiently analyze the data in CSV files. This will be a great opportunity for us to expand our knowledge of SQL and its various functions.

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, we will have a clean dataset that can be used for further analysis and insights into Superstore's sales and profits.
